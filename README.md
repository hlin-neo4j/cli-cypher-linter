# Cypher Syntax Checker CLI
Leverages the grammar and antlr4 source code from the cypher-editor project, credit to them. A work in progress for something I hope to rewrite as an actual vscode extension for Cypher highlighting and syntax checking.

# To run as a user prompt:
`npm run start`
Then enter a cypher query lint check it.
